# reconScout

A simple bash script for stealth Nmap SYN scans. Beginner experimentation. Open to feedback.

## Usage

```bash
./reconScout.sh <target IP or domain>

## Planned Features

- Save scan output to a file
- Support scanning multiple targets from a list
- Optional verbose mode (`-v`)
- Parse Nmap results for open ports only
